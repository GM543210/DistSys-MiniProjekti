# The Plan

## 1. Set up a Python virtual environment and install the necessary libraries and dependencies, including a web framework such as Flask or Django to handle HTTP requests and responses, and a database library such as SQLite or MySQL to store and retrieve data.
    
    1 .Open VS Code and select File > Open Folder from the menu. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and select it. This will open the selected folder in a new VS Code window.

    2. In the terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code window, create a new virtual environment by running the following command:

    3. Copy code
py -3 -m venv env
This will create a new directory called env in your project directory, which will contain the Python executable and the necessary libraries and files for the virtual environment.

        Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
        Copy code
        .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    This will activate the virtual environment for the current terminal session. You should see the name of the virtual environment in the command prompt, like this:

    4. Copy code
        (env) C:\path\to\project>
            Install the necessary libraries and dependencies by running the following command:
    5. Copy code
        pip install flask mysql-connector-python
        This will install Flask, a web framework for Python, and mysql-connector-python, a library for connecting to a MySQL database from Python. Replace mysql-connector-python with the library of your choice if you are using a different database.

    6. In VS Code, create a new file called main.py in your project directory and add the following code to it:
        Copy code
            from flask import Flask

            app = Flask(__name__)

            @app.route('/')

            def index():
            return 'Hello, World!'

            if __name__ == '__main__':
                app.run()
    7. python main.py - runnam i dobivam link

## 2. Define the database schema and create a database instance. You will need to create a table to store the data, and define columns for fields such as the ID, data, and any other relevant information.

## 3. Write a function to fill the database with test data. This function can read the data from a file or generate it programmatically.

## 4. Define a route in the web framework that handles requests to the API endpoint. When a request is received, the route should retrieve the requested data from the database and return it to the client in the appropriate format (e.g., JSON).

## 5. Test the API by sending requests to the endpoint and verifying that the correct data is returned.
